I’m a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate from Colorado State University with a focus on advanced manufacturing and a strong interest in aerospace and automotive applications. My academic background and hands-on experience have given me a solid foundation in traditional, additive, and composite manufacturing processes, as well as material selection for mechanical design.

Through my senior design project and involvement with Formula SAE, I’ve applied engineering principles to real-world challenges, strengthening my problem-solving, teamwork, and technical skills. I’m proficient in SolidWorks, MATLAB, and CNC machining, with growing interests in heat transfer, design optimization, and advanced materials.
